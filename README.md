# eXOtended
A project I coded the summer before IB hit me insane in high school

Basically something I did in 2021 I guess

No but seriously I coded this back then and planned to make it into something serious and something more. I thought of it as an actual game I would develop with an app and all that, but of course that didn't happen.

I'm still proud of this piece of work, and it is kind of the only project I'm genuinely proud of that I coded after all these years. However, I don't plan on continuing to develop this or do anything with it.

That's why I'm pushing it onto this account, because I want to separate it from my main as it is not the current me at all, but with the sheer amount of effort and hours I put into this, it clearly deserves some recognition to at least be put public.

I made this before I had the concept of front-end and back-end development and had terrible coding practices, so don't use this program to judge my coding ability since it is definitely way better now, but it still has a soft spot in my heart because I remembered how much this little program meant to me. Afterall, I did include it in my personal statement that got me into CS in college, not that it is even a main part of the personal statement, but still.

I didn't import any libraries really other than tkinter and basic font libraries, because I liked coding everything myself, something that I still am guilty of today, haha. I guess some things don't change :p

It is just the file eXOtended.py, if you are curious in running it. Try running it with Python's IDLE.

If the screen gets cut off weirdly, find the line where I wrote "ratio = 1" and change it to "ratio = 60/94" and it should be fine.
